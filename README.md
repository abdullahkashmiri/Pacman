#Pacman Game
As part of my Object-Oriented Programming course at FAST-NUCES, Lahore, I developed a Pacman game using SFML and C++. This project provided hands-on experience in game development, combining graphics, user interaction, and game logic within an object-oriented design framework.

The game features the classic Pacman gameplay where the player navigates a maze, collecting dots and avoiding ghosts. Utilizing SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), I implemented key game components such as rendering graphics, managing user input, and handling game state updates. The project involved designing and coding various game elements, including the maze layout, Pacman's movement, ghost AI, and collision detection.

Throughout the development process, I focused on applying object-oriented principles to structure the game's code. This included creating classes for different game entities (e.g., Pacman, ghosts, and dots), employing inheritance for shared behavior, and using polymorphism for dynamic interactions. The project not only enhanced my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of game development principles and the SFML library.

By completing this project, I demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical concepts in a practical context, creating a functional and engaging game that showcases my proficiency in C++ and SFML. This experience also reinforced my skills in problem-solving, debugging, and adhering to best practices in software development.
